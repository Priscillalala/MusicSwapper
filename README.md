# Music Swapper
Choose which music tracks play on each stage!

## Config
You can use the *Tracks* config file generated by this mod to choose the main track and Teleporter track (if applicable) of each stage. Additionally, you can define a second set of tracks that will play only after looping once in a run. Please note that DLC-exclusive track choices will only be applied if you own the required DLC.

**The *Tracks* config file generates with the following changes by default:**

- **Scorched Acres' main track is ["It Can’t Rain All the Time"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/it-cant-rain-all-the-time)** (formerly ["Disdrometer"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/disdrometer-2))
- **After looping: Distant Roost's Teleporter track changes to ["Hydrophobia"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/hydrophobia-2)** (usually ["Thermodynamic Equilibrium"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/thermodynamic-equilibrium-2))
- **After looping: Titanic Plains' Teleporter track changes to ["Hydrophobia"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/hydrophobia-2)** (usually ["Thermodynamic Equilibrium"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/thermodynamic-equilibrium-2))
- **After looping: Siphoned Forest's Teleporter track changes to ["A Boat Made from a Sheet of Newspaper"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/a-boat-made-from-a-sheet-of-newspaper)** (usually ["Having Fallen, It Was Blood"](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/having-fallen-it-was-blood))

You can reset these changes individually with your preferred config editor. If you wish to generate a completely fresh config file with no changes, open your config file in a text editor and delete all the contents (leave the empty config file when launching the game).

**This mod also generates a small *Extras* config file with the following changes by default:**

- **The Teleporter hum volume is reduced by 50%**
- **Solutional Haunt's main track continues playing after the boss fight**
