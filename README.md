# Music Swapper
Choose which music tracks play on each stage!

## Config
You can use the config file generated by this mod to choose the main track and Teleporter track (if applicable) of each stage. Additionally, you can define a second set of tracks that will play only after looping once in a run. Please note that DLC-exclusive track choices will only be applied if you own that DLC.

**The config file generates with the following changes by default:**

- **The Scorched Acres main track is "[It Can’t Rain All the Time](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/it-cant-rain-all-the-time)"** (formerly "[Disdrometer](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/disdrometer-2)")
- **After looping: the Distant Roost Teleporter track changes to "[Hydrophobia](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/hydrophobia-2)"** (usually "[Thermodynamic Equilibrium](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/thermodynamic-equilibrium-2)")
- **After looping: the Titanic Plains Teleporter track changes to "[Hydrophobia](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/hydrophobia-2)"** (usually "[Thermodynamic Equilibrium](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/thermodynamic-equilibrium-2)")
- **After looping: the Siphoned Forest Teleporter track changes to "[A Boat Made from a Sheet of Newspaper](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/a-boat-made-from-a-sheet-of-newspaper)"** (usually "[Having Fallen, It Was Blood](https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/track/having-fallen-it-was-blood)")

You can reset these changes individually with your preferred config editor. If you wish to generate a completely fresh config file with no changes, open your config file in a text editor and delete all the contents (leave the empty config file when launching the game).
